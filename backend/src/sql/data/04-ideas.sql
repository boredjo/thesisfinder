The same equation that models the expansion without the need for dark energy, also models the gravitational curves for galaxies without the need for dark matter. Furthermore, this same equation resolves the infinite velocities found at a singularity. For of you who are wondering, this theory proposes that time is actually a function of light so no matter where you are, you always measure the same value of c regardless of how much c varies relative to a universal time.

And what is the relationship between dark energy and quantum gravi", "anonymous", "The concept of a quantized vacuum effectively acting behind the scenes as a medium for the strong and electroweak interactions, and gravity is not a new topic in science and physics, and was brought back decades ago by string theory and other quantum gravity theories. such as quantum loop gravity, gravitons or superfluid vacuum theory (SVT), all of which attempt to explain the origin of gravity. and all the other four known forces as intrinsic and intrinsic physical properties of the vacuum that many today believe that deciphering the vacuum is the key to answering great unsolved problems in physics such as the cosmological constant. Dark energy and dark matter can be said that quantum vacuum research is of great importance for the body to go beyond the standard model of particle physics research, the development of quantum field theory, and the development of cosmology.
these days. After matter and light, vacuum is perhaps the last frontier that we must conquer to understand the nature and fundamental level of the universe at its best. However, all these theories that attempt to explain the phenomenon of the vacuum limit themselves by using and obeying the speed of causality dictated by the visible speed of light c, the basis for explaining all visible matter and energy in our universe and their interactions. , but vacuum is not light. And not matter, it is the lack of these that does not necessarily translate into nothingness. The best clue nature gives us is that the vacuum is not nothingness, it is the bounded zero point energy (ZPE) and vacuum fluctuations (ZPF). And virtual particles flow in and out of the vacuum, which, however, contradicts the massive vacuum energy predicted by QED. Density is therefore the cosmological constant difference and perhaps the greatest unsolved problem in physics today. Therefore, the author here supports by ansatz the idea that by observing the ZPE and ZPF vacuum combined with the cosmological constant problem, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg and most of the intact vacuum energy is hidden from us and inaccessible. Our device ZPF and ZPE hidden vacuum energy only shows that the 'conversion' is not complete and is the Heisenberg matter. The Uncertainty Principle In this context, if this theorized untouched and untouched type of vacuum energy is hidden, outside our phase of spacetime and beyond ordinary matter and known light, it can be assumed that our known physics must also be primitive and Essentially by violating the 'holy grail' that is the speed of light in a vacuum, therefore, the absolute speed of causality is violated. After that, all ordinary matter and ordinary light energy and all four fundamental forces in our observable universe can be explained. And it worked as a manifestation in our spacetime of a locally disturbed and flawed vacuum. With the fourth force is therefore gravity
The only force that can be transmitted to us from the total energy of the hidden vacuum not only disturbed but intact. The latter spacetime also explains dark energy and possible dark matter phenomena, and why these seem so elusive. However, proof of the superluminosity property for a hypothetical sub-Planck-sized vacuum quantum, possibly analogous to a boson, is a
A waste of work using well-known theories that forbid this in the first place because they are based on the c-speed limit.

("MjAyNDAzMjEyMDQ4NDYxOTMwMzQ=", "【NO.34】How the View of Space-Time is Unified (6) - Are Vacuum and Space Two Separate Things?", "anonymous", "The historical evolution of the concept of 'vacuum' [1] can be roughly described as the following.
0) Buddhist Vacuum: the void formlessness, the empty barrier-free. It refers to the place and space where all dharmas exist. There are four meanings: pervasive, immovable, endless, and eternal.
I) Conceptual Vacuum: Aristotle in ancient Greek era believed that ' Void separated from the matter does not exist' [2], the void must be filled with matter in order to be able to carry out physical action*. The concept of vacuum at this stage is void, a state of space.
II) Industrial vacuum: Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647), secretary and assistant of Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), proved the 'vacuum' without an atmosphere using a mercury barometer [3]. The concept of vacuum at this stage was static and overlapped with Newton's absolute space.
III) Ether Vacuum: ......, as the recipient of energy, is to regard it as continuously filling all space, and possessing the mobility of fluid rather than the rigidity of a solid. If whatever possess the property of inertia be matter, then the medium is a form of matter. But away from ordinary matter it is, for obvious reasons, best to call it as usual by a separate name, the ether.'[4] 'The aether is the solitary tenant of the universe, save for that infinitesimal fraction of space which is occupied by ordinary matter.'[5]. The vacuum at this stage is the medium through which electromagnetic waves can travel.
IV) Quantum Vacuum: Along with the development of quantum mechanics, numerous vacuum-related concepts have arisen, the ground state, the various excited states, zero point energy, negative energy sea, spontaneous emission, Vacuum polarization, vacuum fluctuations, etc.. 'The vacuum is, in fact, precisely the ground state of the fundamental many-field system. '[9]† 'In a quantum theory, the vacuum is a very busy place. Particle-antiparticle pairs are constantly produced out of nothing, violating the energy-conservation law by borrowing an amount of energy E from the vacuum for a time t such that Et<ℏ, according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. 'As the Higgs boson propagates in the quantum vacuum, it feels the presence of virtual particles and interacts with them.'[6] and theoretically and experimentally identified the Casimir effect for verifying vacuum energy[7][8], and the Lamb shift. The concept of vacuum at this stage provides a self-consistent ground for quantum field theory, where the vacuum is seen as a separate background for spacetime.
V) Relativity Vacuum: Quantum field theory predicts that a uniformly accelerated particle detector sees the vacuum as a thermal bath with temperature T related to its proper acceleration a, i.e., T =a/2π, as a result of the interaction between the detector and the fluctuating vacuum scalar fields, and this is called the Fulling-Davies-Unruh (FDU) effect. Vacuum and space appear to be separate.
VI) Planck Scales Vacuum: Some of the new physics considers the vacuum to be more complex, with the emergence of Quantum foams [11], Spin foams, Quantum spacetime [12], String Network, Lattice structure, Conformal structure [13], and other concepts [14]. Space is discretized and the Vacuum seems to merge with Space again.
VII) Dark Energy Vacuum: It is believed by some people that the vacuum energy is dark energy, and therefore the vacuum is a place with a certain dark energy density. In this case, the vacuum has the effect of the cosmological constant Λ [15], which is the driving force for the accelerated expansion of space-time.
It appears that the relationship between the various vacuums and space is not consistent. Without a clear definition on this most fundamental issue of physics, it may already be a potential obstacle to progress.",

Meanings of ‘Matter’ and ‘Energy’ Contrasted: By ‘matter´ I mean whatever exists as the venue of finite activities of existents and itself finitely active in all parts. Matter is whatever is interconvertible with existent energy.
Existent ‘energy’ is conceived as those propagative wavicles which, in a given world of existents, function as the fastest existent media of communication of someeffects between any two or more chunks of matter or of energy (i.e., of motions / changes).
Existent matter and existent energy are inter-convertible, and hence both should finally be amenable to a common definition: whatever exists with, in all parts, finite activity and stability.",

I search the internet for qbits and find that they are used in quantum computing. I'm not learning anything from that. Some discussions on the internet talk about superpositions of quantum states. I already know about superpositions of quantum states. I already know about the deterministic time evolution of states between measurements, and the probabilistic effects of measurements. And I know a little about quantum entanglement. But I still have absolutely no idea how any of this is used for computing. The literature I found on the internet mentions all things above without any explanation of how we use that for computing. Can you help to explain this?",

It's usually represented as containing contradictions (opposite spins of electrons). Therefore it's claimed that Aristotle's Logic does not work here. But is this ´superposition thing´ a quality or an explanation of a quality?
What if this particle disappers and appears so quickly that, and we're saying (while it's disappered) ´it's in a superposition state´ ? I mean, containing contradictions is OK for non physical being, because there is no existence at that moment? But when electron exists, it has only one spin. Is it possible to explain superposition in such way? Are there any similar comments by physicists?",
